# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I am feeling more confident using the each method than I did with the previous methods lesson.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

This was definitely a more advanced concept, but doing the live lesson really helped clarify any confusion I may have had before tacking the each.rb challenges.  Thankfully, not much struggle with this one.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

In this lesson, I want to go back and do all of the practice problems on my own.  I will use my Friday early evening time to tackle these problems.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No questions on this lesson, but I go to my peers and leader in my small group if anything comes up.
